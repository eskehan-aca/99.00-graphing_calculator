# Work Report
## Name: <ins> Elizabeth Skehan </ins>
*FALL 2021 | CS003A | GRAPHING CALCULATOR FINAL*

## Features üåü
- enter equation
  - wait for unique equation
  - modify selected equation 
- display help menu
- save file
- load file
- reset calculator
- center origin
- reset view (home)
- force update equation
- pan with arrow keys
- zoom with +/- keys
- display graph's info
- edit number of points plotted
- display equation of current graph
- display equation history
  - right click to graph selected
  - left click to delete selected from history
- display mouse coordinates
- display graph mode + status messages

### ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS: üìå
*as explicitly listed from canvas/discord*
- ‚úÖ user input from screen
- ‚úÖ clickable equation history 
- ‚úÖ equation history (save, load) 
- ‚úÖ user interactions (zoom, pan)
- ‚úÖ math functions (trig, log, abs, sqrt, unary minus)
- ‚ùå demonstrative video
- ‚ùå commented code
- ‚ùå full testing suite?

### REFLECTIONS: üí¨
- project organization
  - needing to establish design guidelines (clearly outlining what should be handled by what class, hierarchies, rules, design structure, etc). 
  - keeping track of implemented features as they are created
- time management/future
  - prioritizing more important features rather than 'fun' ones
  - having a project overview/goal setting?
- environment (not as important)
  - unsure how to include testing
  - unsure how to link git repos/histories

### KNOWN BUGS: üêõ
*these are not hard to correct, i just haven't gotten around to it yet*
- missing points w/ transparency
- animate class -> "locked" into calc modes

  - vector for cmds/cmd names
  - mouse input, modes
- keybinds (help display)
  - modifying keybinds
  - vector of cmds?
  - multiple pages?
- saving/loading functions
  - duplicates in immediate list
  - saved functs vs equation history
  - custom saves, save names
  - select with num keys
  - using vector??
- other
  - clean constants.h
  - remove function.cpp missing return types 
  - remove duplicate rpn code for var/no var

üßÆ MISC:
